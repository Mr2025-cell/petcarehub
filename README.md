## About The Project

**Pet Care Hub** is an all-in-one mobile-first website application designed for connecting responsible pet owners to reliable pet sitters. Be it for regular dog walking services, cat sitting while you are out of town, or even giving medicine to your pet animal, Pet Care Hub has got you covered.

### The Problem We Solve

Many pet owners face problems with coordinating care among different people, including relatives, friends, or professionals. Information gets mixed in messages, tasks are not executed, and it is impossible to know whether the care was given to your pet or not. Moreover, caregivers do not have instructions and cannot document their work.

### Our Idea

Pet Care Hub will offer:

- **Shared care plans** to ensure all information about care procedures and schedules is known;
- **GPS tracking** of the pet's walks in real time;
- **Evidence photos** that confirm tasks were fulfilled, for example, a walk;
- **Support offline mode** to record data even in case of lacking an Internet connection;
- **Secure booking procedure** to establish a contact between owners and professionals.

Team Contribution:

Pet Care Hub’s success can be attributed to the hard work of everyone involved in the project.

Mr2025-cell was responsible for project leadership and development of UC5: Active Care Session. This included real-time GPS location tracking with offline capability, owner live location tracking, and photo upload after the completion of walking the dog. He also addressed bugs such as “Add New Pet” and “Edit Profile,” made the page for the “My Pets” list, and solved booking issues to make sure everything integrated smoothly.

TobiTobs-code was responsible for UC7: Admin Dashboard & Content Moderation. This included implementing the admin dashboard, caregiver verification queue, complaint manager, and reported review moderation. The admin can approve or reject caregiver qualifications, mark complaints as under review or resolved, and hide or restore reported reviews. TobiTobs-code also added the Admin, Qualification, Complaint, and Rating class models and connected the admin pages to the app routes.

As a frontend developer, kartikeyapro1 laid down the groundwork of the entire application. This included creating the login and registration forms for authentication, dashboards based on different roles, toast notification for user interaction, and a fully responsive navigation bar for both desktop and mobile platforms.

ThanadolKamwongsa emphasized the care planning process as the backend developer, developing the care plan generation and management system. This includes creating recurring activities, scheduling tasks with specific times of day, and integrating care plans into the pet profile and caregiver dashboard.

Ali Tauqir created the marketplace component as the marketplace developer, designing the booking process from scratch. This includes searching for caregivers through filters, managing their availability, creating and canceling bookings, and generating payment stubs to illustrate the monetization process of the platform.

Sunny-1118 helped design the user interface as the UI developer, designing the pet profile viewing page to display pet details, including medical alerts and emergency contacts.
